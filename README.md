Homework   #1 (Due   Monday, February   24th,   11:59 pm)
Homework Guidelines:
Your solutions to homework assignments will be submitted and graded through Gradescope   (see the   Gradescope tab   on   your   Courseworks   dashboard).
You will have two options for submitting your work in Gradescope, either:    1)   upload individual   scanned   images   of your handwritten pages (e.g., using your phone), one or more per question; or 2)   upload a single   PDF   that you   create   which contains the whole submission (e.g., merge files on your computer   or phone with   a   software   of   your choice).
Please use the naming convention Lastname_HWxx.pdf   when submitting your homework assignment. You may choose to type up your calculations, in which case show all your steps   and highlight   your   solution.   Note:   During      the   upload, Gradescope   will   ask   you   to   mark   which   page/s   each   problem   is   on   (see   examplehere).   It   is   important that you follow that step for grading purposes.It   is   acceptable   to   discuss   problems   with   your   colleagues, and   questions   are   encouraged   during   office   hours, but   all   work must be done independently. Make sure to clearly show all work on   each problem   and that your   solutions   are      presented in an orderly fashion. It is your responsibility to make your   solutions   easy to   grade.

Problem #1   (20 pts)The relatively unique properties of   water are among the reasons why it plays such a key role in the   Earth's climate. Chief   among these properties are the ones that couple energy and water processes.   This   problem is designed to   provide some experience with these   properties in the context   of   simple   examples. Provide all answers in   standard   SI units.
a)   Suppose you have a 2 cm   x   2   cm   x   2   cm   ice   cube   that   is   frozen   at   a   temperature   of   0°C.      How   much energy (in Joules) input would be required to melt it?
b) Suppose you are making yourself 1.50 liters of   tea but its temperature is   75°C, which is too hot   for   you to drink. In order   to   cool its temperature,   you immerse five ice cubes of   the same dimension   as the   one in part   (a) in your   tea.   If   the   energy   used   to   melt   the   ice   came   solely   from   the   internal   energy   (i.e., temperature)   of   the   tea, what   would   the   reduced   temperature   of   your   tea   be   after   all   five   ice   cubes   have   melted   (where   you   may   assume   tea   is   made   up   entirely   of   water)?   For   simplicity, in this class you may generally use a value of 1000 kg/m3    for the   density   of   water.c)   The tea   will also cool as a   result of   evaporation. Suppose the evaporation   rate from the tea vessel   is   5   ×   10-4   kg/m2/s   and   occurs   over   the   tea   surface   area   of   80   cm2.   How   much   more   will   the   temperature   of the   tea   change   as   a result   of evaporative   cooling   over   10 minutes? Note   that you   can assume the mass change in tea due to evaporation   is negligible here.
Problem #2   (20 pts)
The reservoir behind a small Earth dam in the Midwest   can be reasonably represented   as   a cylinder with a radius of 150   [m]. The water in it   stands   as   it had   a uniform   depth   of   1.0   [m]   in May 2014. In May 2015 the water depth stood at   0.7   [m].   During   this   same period   a   nearby   precipitation gauge measured a cumulative of   0.9   [m] of   precipitation. A river feeds this pond.   A    river gauge measured an average of   2.0   [m3   hr-1] flow. The   local   farm uses代 写Hydrosystems Engineering (EACEE 3250 / 4250) Spring 2025 Homework #1Java
代做程序编程语言 the reservoir   for water   supply; during the year the amount used was 0.1 m3   hr-1. What was the evaporative   loss   from the      lake during the May 2014 to May 2015 period?
Problem #3   (20 pts)
A large room in a museum has a 3-meter-high   ceiling   and   its   lateral   dimensions   are   10 by   15   meters. To preserve the artwork, it is imperative that the   specific humidity be kept   at   10   g/kg   and   air temperature maintained between 20ºC and 25ºC. Due to a power outage,   the climate   control system responsible for maintaining conditions in the room fails.
You are called to help fix the problem and by the time you   arrive your measurements   indicate that the air relative humidity is   80% with an air temperature of   21ºC   and   air pressure of   1000   mb.   You have a portable dehumidifier that takes in air from the closed   room,   removes   water   vapor by   condensing the vapor into liquid, and then discharges the dry   air back   into the   closed   room.   You         run the dehumidifier until the specific humidity is lowered to the required value.
a) What mass of   water (in kilograms) will need to be condensed out to reach the required humidity level?
b) What is the amount of   energy released (in Joules) as   a result   of   condensing   the   humidity?
c) Assuming the energy computed in part b) goes into warming the   air, what   is the   expected rise   in air temperature due to the dehumidification. Note: The specific heat   capacity   of   air   is   1004   J/kg/K. For your calculation, you may assume   that the change in air   density   (or   change   in   air   mass) is   negligible   as   a   result   of   the   heating/dehumidification.
d) Will the air temperature still be in the necessary range as   a result   of   the   dehumidification   or   will it need to be additionally cooled? Explain.
Problem #4   (20 pts)
Suppose the observed water vapor   density from the surface to   an   altitude   of 8 km at   an   arbitrary   location is described by the following exponential decay function:

where the surface vapor density (rv0) is equal to   11   g   (H2O) m-3,   and   H   is   a   length   scale describing how quickly the variable decays with height.   Suppose H = 4 km at this   location.
a) What is the precipitable water (in cm of   water) of   the   8 km   atmospheric   column?
b) Increased greenhouse gases are expected to result in   an   increase   in   atmospheric temperature. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that the   increase   in   the   next   100   years may be between 0.6- 3.4 K.   Conceptually, briefly discuss the effect that the   increase   in temperature will have on maximum water storage in the atmosphere (e.g.,   is   air   capable   of holding more or less water?). Comment on how this might affect precipitation   (frequency   and   rates).
Problem #5   (20 pts)
In   order to plan the day’s irrigation rate, a farmer needs to   estimate the maximum potential   water   loss rate by estimating the absorbed radiative energy at the   surface. Over the   irrigated   field   at noon, the ground temperature is generally 41ºC and the air temperature   is   33ºC.   The   air   dew point temperature is   16ºC. Assume a surface albedo of   30%   and   surface   emissivity   of   0.95.
Based on location and day (Day   186), the cosine   of   the   solar   zenith   angle   at   noon   is   estimated   to   be 0.974. Assume the atmospheric direct beam shortwave transmissivity at this   time   is   0.6,   the diffuse shortwave scattering coefficient is 0.1   and the   sky   is   cloud-free.
a) Determine the net radiation at the   surface. You can assume   that   εa = 0.809   (rather   than   use   a   model   to   estimate   it).
b) Assuming 65% of   the net radiation goes into evapotranspiration   (i.e., latent heat   flux)   at   the            surface, how much water should the farmer apply (in mm/day) to balance the   evapotranspiration   flux?
